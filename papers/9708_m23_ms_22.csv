2(b),Assess whether all market economies should become mixed economies.,"Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and Table B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.

Indicative content
Responses may include:

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
• NO: Explanations of why market economies should remain as they are,
e.g., because there is no (or minimal) government intervention, decisions are taken on the basis of demand and supply, competition is encouraged and so production is more efficient, and consumers and producers act on their own self-interest.

• YES: Explanations of why market economies should become mixed economies,
e.g., because in a market economy there is non-provision of public goods, the under-consumption of merit goods, the over-consumption of demerit goods and the existence of markets where prices are too low, too high, or too unstable.

A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.

AO3 Evaluation
Evaluation of whether all market economies should become mixed economies leading to a justified conclusion.
Points to consider may include whether governments should provide public goods, merit goods, reduce the provision of demerit goods, intervene in the price mechanism, etc.
A one-sided response cannot gain any marks for evaluation.

• up to 3 marks for AO1 Knowledge and understanding
• up to 3 marks for AO2 Analysis
• up to 2 marks for AO3 Evaluation.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding (max 3 marks)
A clear knowledge and understanding of at least two possible economic reasons for inequality of income, such as:

• Encourages enterprise
• Encourages workers to retrain/reskill
• Demotivates those on the lowest incomes and an increase in crime
• Increased government spending on transfer payments leading to an opportunity cost

Responses may include:

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
• Diagram of a minimum price in a market, correctly labelled with an equilibrium price and an equilibrium quantity, showing the existence of a minimum price above what would be the case with no government intervention.
• Explanation of the potential advantages and benefits of a minimum price, such as making the prices of demerit goods more expensive to discourage consumption and protecting the incomes of producers in that market.
• Explanation of the potential disadvantages and limitations of a minimum price, such as the creation of excess supply and the greater likelihood of producers becoming less efficient, and of why the introduction of a minimum price might be ineffective.

Note: Omission of a diagram/inaccurate diagram can only achieve a maximum of Level 2.
A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.

AO3 Evaluation
• Evaluation of the potential effectiveness of the introduction of a minimum price in a market.

• up to 3 marks for AO1 Knowledge and understanding
• up to 3 marks for AO2 Analysis
• up to 2 marks for AO3 Evaluation.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding (max 3 marks)
A clear knowledge and understanding that the circular flow of income in a closed economy involves households, firms, and the government (1) and has injections of I and G and leakages/withdrawals of S and T (1), so that equilibrium income is where I + G = S + T (1).

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
An analysis of how the circular flow of income changes as an economy becomes an open economy, with the introduction of participation in the international economy (1) through the injection of X and the leakage/withdrawal of M (1), so that equilibrium income (is) (now becomes) where I + G + X = S + T + M (1).

AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.

Indicative content
Responses may include:

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
• The positive consequences of economic growth: an improvement in the standard of living, a reduction in the rate of unemployment, an increase in incomes, an increase in the level of aggregate demand, a possible reduction in income inequality, higher tax revenues which a government could spend on improving public services (such as education and healthcare), and an increase in business confidence leading to greater investment.
• The negative consequences of economic growth: a possible depletion of non-renewable natural resources and damage to the environment, such as through various types of pollution, an unequal sharing of the benefits of economic growth among a population leading to an increase in income inequality, and a possible reduction in the quality of life of people through longer working hours and a reduction in the amount of leisure time, plus a shift towards more capital-intensive production. Answers may also refer to the dangers of inflationary pressure.

A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.

AO3 Evaluation
Points to consider may include:
• The degree to which the potential benefits of economic growth are equally shared among a population.
• The extent to which any shift towards more capital-intensive production affects the level of unemployment.
• Whether long-term economic growth brings about a short-term cost as resources are used to produce capital goods rather than consumer goods.
• The extent to which the economic growth is sustainable.
• Which leads to a justified conclusion on whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive.

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
An analysis of the potential advantages of an appreciation, such as a reduction in the prices of imports, both of finished goods and of raw materials and component parts, reducing inflationary pressures in an economy. An analysis of the potential disadvantages of an appreciation, such as an increase in the price of exports making them less competitive.
Note: maximum mark of 2 if only advantages or disadvantages discussed.

AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)
Offers a valid judgement on whether the potential advantages of an appreciation of an exchange rate always outweigh the potential disadvantages (1) to reach a conclusion. (1) N.B the significance of elasticities and the MLC may be rewarded but must not be expected as they are A2 topics.",8,3,3,2
5(b),Assess whether supply-side policies are the most effective way to correct a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments of an economy.,"Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and Table B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.

Indicative content
Responses may include:

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
• Successful supply-side policies will cause a rightward shift in the long-run AS curve, reflecting more efficient production. This would make a country’s products more competitive in international markets and so there is likely to be an increase in net exports, correcting a deficit in the current account.
• Supply-side policies could include improvements in training and education, making labour markets more flexible, reductions in the powers of trade unions, an increase in competition, and a reduction in rules and regulations.
• Potential disadvantages of supply-side policies are that they are essentially a long-run solution and so may take a relatively long period of time to have an impact, such as improvements in training and education. Some of the policies could be quite expensive and so would involve the government in considerable expenditure, money which could have been spent elsewhere (giving rise to the issue of opportunity cost).

Guidance: There are a number of alternative approaches to answering this question. At the simplest level, analysis and evaluation may focus on an assessment of the effectiveness of supply-side policies only. Furthermore, this may be expanded to include a direct comparison with the effectiveness of alternative policies such as fiscal, monetary, or protectionist policies. In addition, such an assessment may simply be part of evaluation. However, if supply-side policies are ignored or receive scant attention then only a Level 2 mark may be awarded.

A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.

AO3 Evaluation
Points to consider may include:
• The cause of the deficit.
• The cost and ease of introducing various policies.
• The possible unintended consequences of introducing policies, etc.
• Leading to a justified conclusion as to whether supply-side policies would be the most effective way to correct a deficit in the current account of the balance of payments of an economy.
